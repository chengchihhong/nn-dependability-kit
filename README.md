## Structure

There are four packages under nndependability, namely
- metrics: compute dependability metrics for neural networks
- atg: automatic test case generation to improve the metrics
- formal: formal verification (static analysis, constraint solving) of neural networks
- rv: runtime monitoring of neural networks

## Important python packages as requirements

- PyTorch + Numpy 
- [Test case generation] Google optimization research tools (https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/installing/binary)
- [Run-time monitoring] dd (binary decision diagram implemented using python)
